"""Negative control of compare_proc_geometry.py: a perturbed dump MUST fail the comparison.

    compare_proc_geometry_negative_control.py <decomposed case dir>

Copies the case's brae_procGeometry.dump files to a scratch tree (the case is never written) and runs three
mutations, each of which has to make the comparator exit nonzero:
  weight  the first processor face's weight is changed by 1e-6 relative;
  delta   the first processor face's delta x component is changed by 1e-6 relative;
  slot    the second face's halo slot is replaced by slot+100 (structure, not numbers);
  faces   the LAST face record of the first patch is dropped (the zip truncation guard).
Exit 0 when every mutation is caught, 1 when one passes silently, 77 when the case has no dumps.

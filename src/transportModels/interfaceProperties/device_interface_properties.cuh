// Interface normal and curvature on the device.

// provenance:
//   openfoam:  src/transportModels/interfaceProperties/interfaceProperties.C:107-165 (calculateK)
//   host:      src/transportModels/interfaceProperties/interface_properties_cpp.cu -- the ORACLE for
//              this file, and itself gated against OpenFOAM's UNMODIFIED class to 2.5e-14 at four
//              calculateK pass counts (tests/interfoam_curvature_vs_openfoam.sh).
//   tests:     tests/test_device_interface_properties.cu (device vs host, on damBreak's own mesh)
//
// WHAT IS ON THE DEVICE AND WHAT IS NOT, and the split is deliberate.
//
//   ON:  the per-face work -- interpolate the cell gradient to the face, divide by
//        (mag + deltaN), dot with Sf. That is every internal face and every boundary face, and it runs
//        four times a step (interfaceProperties' constructor, once per alpha corrector per sub-cycle,
//        and again between the sub-cycle and UEqn).
//
//   OFF in general: correctContactAngle and the evaluation of alpha's patches stay with the host hooks.
//   ON for one validated family (the DeviceContactAngleState below): constantAlphaContactAngle walls
//   beside zeroGradient and empty patches, under an unsmoothed Gauss linear nHat. Every other patch
//   type or scheme keeps the host path (the driver decides and refuses to the host, it never approximates).
//
// THE GRADIENT AND THE DIVERGENCE ARE NOT HERE EITHER: deviceGaussGrad and deviceDiv already exist and
// are gated on their own. This file is the piece between them that is interfaceProperties' own.

# A `startFrom latestTime` restart whose latest time is already >= endTime takes ZERO steps and must end cleanly:
# the End line, exit 0, and no time directory written or touched. Cluster scripts restart a finished stage just to
# confirm it is at the end. (Regression: the end-of-run download of the interface forces' boundary rho read an
# empty device buffer when the hook had never run, and the run died with a segfault.)
# Also checks the neighbours: a restart that takes one step, and one that takes the rest of the run.
#   tests/interfoam_zero_step_restart.sh <case dir with startFrom latestTime, adjustTimeStep yes> [brae_interFoam]
# e.g. ~/code/sketches/g4_tank_refill_interfoam/case (first run to 0.008 takes ~30 s on an RTX 5090 laptop)

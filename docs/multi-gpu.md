# Multi-GPU `interFoam`

One case across up to 8 GPUs of one node, one process per GPU, with OpenFOAM's own `-parallel` semantics: the mesh is
split by OpenFOAM's `decomposePar` (`processorN/` directories), processor patches are coupled interfaces, each rank
builds its own preconditioner, and reductions are global. Results can be checked against OpenFOAM `-parallel` on the
same decomposition. Single-GPU runs are unchanged (byte for byte, checked by the test suite).

## Quick start

```bash
cd my-case
sed -i 's/^numberOfSubdomains .*/numberOfSubdomains 4;/' system/decomposeParDict
decomposePar -force                     # OpenFOAM v2606; scotch, simple and hierarchical are accepted

mpirun --bind-to none -np 4 brae_interFoam -case . -parallel -device
reconstructPar -latestTime              # the global time directory from processor0..N
```

`-parallel` reads the dictionaries from the case and the mesh, fields and output from each rank's `processor<rank>/`.
`startFrom latestTime` resolves against `processor0`, and every rank reads its own `processor<rank>/<latestTime>`
(including `uniform/time` and `uniform/cumulativeContErr`), so a decomposed run can be restarted.

For the common function objects, `volFieldValue` and `surfaceFieldValue` are globally reduced, probes use the lowest
owning rank, `fieldMinMax` reports the winning rank, and `pulseStop` reads the globally reduced value so all ranks stop
together. Only rank 0 writes `postProcessing/`; every rank writes its own `uniform/`.

## Restrictions

Refused by name under `-parallel`: `processorCyclic`, `cyclicAMI`/`cyclicACMI`, dynamic refinement, topology change and
moving meshes, MRF zones, `fvOptions`, any turbulence model but laminar, and `pcorr` with `nNonOrthogonalCorrectors > 0`.
The `surfaces` function object is noticed but not run; `writeFields true` on a field-value object and
`exprField autowrite true` are refused.

## Options

Command line (`brae_interFoam`; the `brae` launcher forwards them):

| option | effect |
|---|---|
| `-parallel` | read the case as decomposed by `decomposePar` |
| `-rank N -nprocs M` | the rank and the process count, when not taken from the launcher. Otherwise read from `OMPI_COMM_WORLD_RANK/SIZE`, `PMI_RANK/SIZE` or `SLURM_PROCID/NTASKS`; the explicit flags win |

Environment:

| variable | effect |
|---|---|
| `BRAE_COMM` (or `BRAE_COMM_BACKEND`) | `loopback`, `mpi`, `nccl` or `auto` (default: NCCL when built, more than one rank, and the ranks of a node fit its GPUs; else MPI-host). `BRAE_COMM_NP` sets the loopback rank count; the loopback backend is for test fixtures, not for `mpirun` |
| `BRAE_GPU_MAP="g0,g1,..."` | node-local rank `i` uses GPU `gi` (see `tools/proc_comm_nccl/` for a placement tool); applied before any CUDA context exists; an invalid map aborts the job |
| `BRAE_NCCL_ALLOW_SHARED_GPU=1` | let several NCCL ranks share one GPU (testing on a single-GPU machine) |
| `BRAE_PROC_GRAPH=0` | run the distributed AMG-PCG / symmetric Gauss-Seidel loops host-driven on the NCCL backend too |
| `BRAE_COND_GRAPH=0` | force the host-driven solver loops (`=1` skips the driver check described below) |

Build:

| CMake option | effect |
|---|---|
| `BRAE_WITH_NCCL` (default OFF) | build the NCCL backend; `-DNCCL_ROOT=<dir with include/nccl.h and lib/libnccl.so>` (or `NCCL_HOME`, `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`). NCCL 2.28 or newer is recommended |
| `BRAE_NCCL_TEST_NP` | process counts of the NCCL tests, for example `"1;2;4;8"` (needs that many GPUs) |

## What is in

| piece | what it does | where |
|---|---|---|
| reader and roots | `PatchInfo`/`FvPatch` carry `myProcNo`, `neighbProcNo`, `referPatch`; the case's dictionaries and the rank's `processor<rank>/` mesh, fields, zones and output are separate roots | `src/applications/solvers/common/case_roots.cuh` |
| processor geometry | weights, delta, deltaCoeffs, nonOrthDeltaCoeffs and correction vectors from OpenFOAM's `processorFvPatch` formulas with one setup exchange; bit-identical to OpenFOAM v2606 on the test cases | `src/parallel/processor_coupling.*`, [design note](multigpu-processor-interface.md) |
| device interface | processor faces are the last boundary faces of the device mesh; neighbour reads go through halo slots after the local cells (`nCellsExt = nC + nHalo`) | `src/cuda/device_processor.cuh` |
| `ProcComm` | halo exchange of cell and face fields, deterministic rank-order reductions (host and device-resident), broadcast, collective abort; **loopback**, **MPI-host** and **NCCL** backends; capturable in CUDA graphs | `src/parallel/proc_comm.*` |
| topology | rank-to-GPU placement for NVLink cube-mesh nodes (exhaustive and deterministic), `nvidia-smi topo -m` parser | `src/parallel/proc_topology.*`, `tools/proc_comm_nccl/` |
| distributed solvers | global reductions, processor interface in the matrix product, AMG-PCG with a global stopping decision (all ranks take the same iteration count), symmetric Gauss-Seidel with a halo frozen per sweep, BiCGStab, per-rank AMG hierarchy cache | `src/matrices/lduMatrix/` |
| writer and function objects | per-rank `processor<rank>/<time>` output, byte-identical to OpenFOAM's `decomposePar` output (`reconstructPar` works); the reference cell on one rank; global `deltaN` and end-of-run statistics; function objects reduced across ranks | `inter_writer_cpp.*`, `inter_function_objects.cuh`, `common/proc_globals.cuh` |

Distributed AMG-PCG on a decomposed mesh needs more iterations than one GPU, since each rank's V-cycle is block-local as
in OpenFOAM (OpenFOAM's own `p_rgh` matrix on a 31k-cell case: 58/73/83 iterations at np 2/4/8 against 45 monolithic).

## CUDA graphs and drivers

On the NCCL backend the np > 1 AMG-PCG and symmetric Gauss-Seidel loops run as ONE conditional-`WHILE` graph per rank
(the halo exchange and the deterministic allgather-based reductions inside the body on a graph-only communicator, the
stop decided on the device from the globally reduced residual, so every rank runs the same count). They are
bit-identical to the host-driven loops, which the MPI-host backend runs and `BRAE_PROC_GRAPH=0` selects on NCCL.
`BRAE_PCG_DEVICE=0` and `BRAE_GS_HOST_LOOP=1` also force host loops.

Conditional graph nodes need CUDA 12.4 and a driver r550 or newer. `braeCondGraphsAvailable()` checks the driver's CUDA
version at run time and takes the host-driven loops where it is older. On a data-center GPU whose driver cannot be
upgraded, NVIDIA's `cuda-compat` package (a newer user-mode `libcuda.so` first on `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, no root) enables
the graph loops; it is NVIDIA's proprietary software, so fetch it yourself. It does not help on driver branches NVIDIA's
forward compatibility does not support (every CUDA call then fails with error 803).

The NCCL communicators are process-lifetime and deliberately leaked at exit: after `WHILE` graphs have run on the graph
communicator, `ncclCommDestroy`/`Abort` can wait forever for a global quiescence, so the captured graphs are destroyed
first (a registry in `proc_hooks.cuh`) and the communicators are left to the process teardown.

## Validation

Compared with OpenFOAM v2606 `-parallel` on the same decomposition (a 31,192-cell snappyHexMesh tank with contact-angle
walls, scotch decompositions, every linear solve converged to 1e-12), largest difference over the field's largest value:

| pair | steps | U | p_rgh | phi | alpha |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| OpenFOAM np 1 vs brae np 1 | 100 | 1.9e-9 | 3.1e-10 | 4.1e-9 | 1.8e-11 |
| OpenFOAM np 2 vs brae np 2 | 12 | 9.5e-10 | 2.3e-9 | 6.5e-9 | 8.5e-14 |
| OpenFOAM np 4 vs brae np 4 | 100 | 5.5e-9 | 4.3e-10 | 6.1e-9 | 1.8e-11 |
| brae np 1 vs brae np 2 | 100 | 4.4e-7 | 1.4e-7 | 4.7e-7 | 1.5e-7 |
| brae np 1 vs brae np 4 | 100 | 6.8e-3 | 8.2e-5 | 5.5e-3 | 3.2e-7 |
| OpenFOAM np 1 vs OpenFOAM np 4 | 100 | 6.8e-3 | 8.2e-5 | 5.5e-3 | 3.2e-7 |

A decomposed run differs from the undecomposed one by OpenFOAM's own amount: the np 4 split cuts the free surface,
where the alpha jump across processor faces changes the arithmetic. **Compare with converged solves.** At loose solver
tolerances (`p_rgh` 1e-7, relTol 0.05) OpenFOAM's own np 1, 2 and 4 runs of a case differ from each other by 8e-2 to
3e-1 of U after 12 steps, so such a comparison says nothing about the operators.

Tools and tests:

- `tools/mgpu_oracle/` — the OpenFOAM v2606 oracle: small decomposed cases, serial against `-parallel` runs, per-rank
  operator dumps, a field comparator (`compare_fields.py`), the frozen-state harness (`FROZEN.md`) and the geometry gate.
  `README.md` there describes `setup.sh` and `run_oracle.sh`.
- `tools/spikes/nccl_while_graph/` — NCCL inside a conditional graph `WHILE` body, with a per-GPU-pair sweep.
- `tools/proc_comm_nccl/` — run instructions for the NCCL backend and the placement tool on 2, 4 and 8 GPUs.
- ctest: `proc_comm*` (loopback, MPI, NCCL, graph capture), `dist_solvers_np{2,4,8}`, `mgpu_proc_geometry`,
  `processor_patch_reader`, `mgpu_np1_byte_identical`, and `mgpu_step_parity` — np 2 and 4 against the undecomposed run
  on a sheared, graded tank with converged solves and the pool's surface on the processor cut, bound 1e-6 of U
  (measured 1.2e-9). The oracle tests need OpenFOAM v2606 and a GPU, `mgpu_np1_byte_identical` and `mgpu_step_parity`
  also `mpirun`, and skip otherwise.

## Performance

Measured on one node with 8 Tesla V100-SXM2-32GB (hybrid cube-mesh NVLink, two sockets), NCCL 2.32, CUDA 12.9 with
forward-compatibility libraries (driver 535), ranks placed by the topology tool. Case: a 2,483,933-cell tank refill
(`interFoam`, laminar, MULESCorr, 3 PISO correctors, scotch decompositions), fixed deltaT, 70 steps. Step time is
rank 0's clock between steps 10 and 70, which excludes startup and output; run-to-run noise is about ±1.5 ms at np 8.

| np | ms per step | speedup | parallel efficiency |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 311.9 | 1.00 | 100% |
| 2 | 196.7 | 1.59 | 79% |
| 4 | 106.1 | 2.94 | 73% |
| 8 | 62.3 | 5.01 | 63% |

Converged-solve parity, five fixed steps (tolerance 1e-12, relTol 0), largest difference from np 1 over the field's
largest value:

| np | U | p_rgh | phi | alpha |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 4.3e-10 | 1.8e-10 | 2.3e-9 | 8.7e-11 |
| 4 | 1.7e-10 | 2.3e-10 | 7.8e-10 | 1.1e-12 |
| 8 | 3.4e-9 | 4.2e-10 | 1.7e-8 | 3.1e-10 |

Where the time goes at np 8 (Nsight Systems and the per-phase timer): the compute kernels scale almost perfectly (about
34 ms of kernel time a step per GPU against 197 ms at np 1), the pressure solve is about 55% of the step and the alpha
transport about 27%, and the GPU is idle for roughly a quarter to a third of the step waiting at collectives and
host read-backs. The distributed AMG-PCG's iteration count grows with the number of blocks (np 1: 17 iterations a solve
on average, np 8: 25), which by itself puts the pressure solve at about 4.8x of np 1 instead of 8x.

Tried at np 8 with no gain beyond the run-to-run noise (about ±1.5 ms): the PCG convergence-check cadence, running the
solver as one CUDA graph per rank, NCCL buffer registration, channel count, thread count and protocol, CUDA connection
count, smoothed-aggregation or merged-level AMG hierarchies (`BRAE_AMG_SA`, `BRAE_AMG_MERGE`; a larger coarsest level,
`BRAE_AMG_TARGET`, is slower), and pinning each rank's threads to cores of its GPU's socket. About 60 ms a step (5x)
is the floor for this case without changing the algorithm: a stronger decomposed preconditioner, or capturing a whole
time step as one graph.
